Description:

This project contains a particle system, written in OpenCL, with OpenGL and
GLFW for rendering and displaying it. It integrates over a timestep using a
set of forces.

Completed:
    * Initialize GLFW window and context
    * Initialize GLEW
    * Initialize OpenCL base level function

Things to add:
    * OpenCL context initialization
    * Add JSON configuration file support
    * Proper loading and compilation of OpenCL code
    * Proper set of kernels for calculating a particle or physics simulation
    * Set up of OpenGL and GLSL code
    * Display of particles after interop with OpenGL
    * Camera transforms
