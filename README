Description:

This project contains a particle system, written in OpenCL, with OpenGL and
GLFW for rendering and displaying it. It integrates over a timestep using a
set of forces.

Things to add:
    * Proper loading and compilation of OpenCL code
    * Proper set of kernels for calculating a particle or physics simulation
    * Set up of OpenGL and GLSL code
    * Display of particles after interop with OpenGL
    * Camera transforms
